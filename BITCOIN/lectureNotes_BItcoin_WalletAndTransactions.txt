BITCOIN WALLETS
- software program that allows its user to send and recieve bitcoins
- manages users public and private keys
- encrypted private keys
- user has password/ seed phrase 

KEYS AND ADDRESSES
- keys establish ownership
- digital keys NOT part of bitcoin network
- ind of bitcoin protocol
- can be generated and managed by user's Wallet software without ref to bitcoin blockchain/ internet
- enable properties of bitcoin: decentralized trust, digital ownership, cryptographic security
- transactions require valid digital signature
- only through private key

PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY
- Impossible to cal private key from public key
- Easy to derive public key from private key

- bitcoin key generation -> elliptic curve multiplication
- secp256k1 standard: y^2 = x^3 + 7
- public key = G * private key
- private key => 256b
- public key and G points on curve
- public key => x (256b) and y (256b)
- only x - compressed
- both x and y - uncompressed
- Uncompressed public key => 04xy
- Compressed public key => 02x (even y) or 03x (odd y)

- bitcoin uses Bitcoin address (hash of public key)
- public key -> hash sha256 -> hash RPIEMD 160 -> Public Key Hash (29B) -> Base58Check Encode -> Bitcoin Address
- base58check => version prefix + payload -> Hash(payload) -> version + payload + checksum -> encode in base58

- Private key two forms
- Wallet Input Format (WIF) -- uncompressed public key -- 5 (mainnet)
- Wallet Input Format (WIF) -- compressed public key -- K or L (mainnet)

TRANSACTIONS
- data structures that encode the transfer of values b/w partcipants
- Structure
  -- version 4B
  -- i/p counter 1-9B
  -- i/ps variable
  -- o/p counter 1-9B
  -- o/ps variable
  -- locktime 4B

- Transaction o/s building blocks Bitcoin
- indivisible chuncks of Bitcoin currency recorded in blockchain
- recognized valid by entire blockchain

- full nodes track all available and spendable o/ps - unspent transaction outputs - UTXOs
- new transaction - i/p o/p - one or more UTXOs
- coll of all UTXOs in bitcoin network - UTXO set
- Bitcoin blc = sum of all UTXO that can be spent with priv key

- Bitcoin balance NOT stored in blockchain
- blockchain only stores transactions

- wallets maintains/uses database to track UTXOs

- o/ps come first - Coinbase transactions - special transaction rewarded to miners
- UTXOs format:
  -- amount of bitcoin
  -- locking script size
  -- locking script [cond req to spnd bitcoin] (script public key/ witness script)
- inputs format:
  -- tx hash (of previous UTXO) 32B
  -- output index (previous UTXO) 4B
  -- Unlocking script (size, script, seq no)

- change output
- UTXO spent all or none
- sum of i/p value NOT equal to sum of o/p value
- diff is fee given to miners

- Tx - many inputs
- # of ips and ops incr size of tx data
- fee req in bitcoin depends on size of tx and NOT bitcoins sent
